# CSCE 676 – Semester Project
## Data Mining Project (Phase 1: Data Selection & Initial Analysis)

---

## Project Context

This repository is part of an individual, semester-long data mining project for CSCE 676. Over the course of the semester, the project will evolve through multiple structured deliverables, gradually narrowing focus and increasing technical depth.

The project milestones include:

- Data Selection
- Initial Research Question
- Deep Dive Analysis
- Project Showcase
- Final Deliverable

This phase focuses on dataset identification, preliminary comparison, and exploratory analysis to motivate a well-scoped research direction.

---

## Purpose of This Phase

The goal of this stage is to:

- Identify multiple candidate datasets suitable for data mining
- Evaluate each dataset’s properties and limitations
- Assess which course and beyond-course techniques are applicable
- Understand data quality, bias, and ethical considerations early
- Select a dataset for deeper investigation in later phases

No final modeling decisions are made at this stage.

---

## Candidate Datasets

Several real-world datasets are examined, chosen to span different data modalities and mining tasks. These include examples of:

- Transactional or interaction data
- Text-heavy user-generated data
- Scientific or observational tabular data

Each dataset is analyzed at a high level to understand feasibility, risks, and opportunities for deeper analysis.

---

## Analysis Approach

For each candidate dataset, the following aspects are considered:

- Supported data mining tasks (course techniques vs. external methods)
- Data quality issues such as missingness, noise, or sparsity
- Algorithmic feasibility given dataset size and structure
- Potential sources of bias
- Ethical and societal considerations

Exploratory data analysis is used to validate assumptions and surface early patterns.

---

## Project Structure

This repository will expand over time. Later phases may include:

- Refined research questions
- Advanced modeling and evaluation
- Comparative algorithmic analysis
- Visualizations and interpretability
- Final written and presentation artifacts

Code and analysis in this phase are exploratory and may be revised or replaced in later stages.

---

## Tools and Environment

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Large datasets may be sampled for practicality during early exploration.

---

## Reproducibility Notes

- All observations in this phase are derived from executed code.
- External techniques are discussed conceptually unless implemented.
- Dataset handling choices may change as the project scope narrows.

---

## Status

This repository currently reflects the **Data Selection** stage of the semester project. Future deliverables will build on the insights developed here.
